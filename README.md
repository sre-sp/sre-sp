- 👋 Hi, I’m @sre-sp
- 👀 I’m interested in infra as code, python and AWS. Outside work, my interests are playing Tennis, watching F1, cycling with my daughter to the park.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to master coding and some drone programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that needs automation on infrastructure deployment in AWS
